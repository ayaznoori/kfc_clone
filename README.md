## The Journey:

The Journey so far has been challenging and fun at the same time for my team this was our `3rd project` and `1st project on React` the deadline was just a week, it all felt like we were working on a real product, and also we tried to enact the overall activity as the real working climate where we used git commands to collaborate throughout the project. The planning, discussions, and other team-relevant activities were done via zoom meetings. Each of us handled different tasks to ensure the successful submission of the project.

## Project Details:

KFC Corporation, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the few brands in America that can boast a rich, decades-long history of success and innovation. We’re at over 24,000 KFC outlets and more than 145 countries and territories around the world. And you know what? There’s still a cook in a kitchen in every last one of them, freshly preparing delicious, complete family meals at affordable prices.
